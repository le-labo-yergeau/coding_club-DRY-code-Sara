## DRY code

In this coding club, we will be discussing about a programming principle aimed at reducing the repetition of code patterns within a script. 
The acronym for this principle is DRY, and stands for: " Don´t Repeat Yourself". 
It was first introduced by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt in their book The Pragmatic Programmer.
DRY code limits redundancy in your script and is desirable because:
-	It avoids wasting time (collaborators’, stakeholders’ and your time alike). 
-	It avoids errors: a modification of any single element does not require multiple subsequent changes in other logically unrelated elements further on your script that are easily overlooked.  
-	It allows your logically related elements to change uniformly, keeping them in sync.

The contrary to DRY code is WET code:
-	Write Everything Twice
-	Write EveryTime
-	We Enjoy Tipying
-	Waste Everyone’s Time
